                    <p class="text-muted">We are with the University of Washington, collaborating with the AMP lab and the Depts. of <a href="https://www.me.washington.edu">Mechanical</a> and <a href="https://www.ece.uw.edu/">Electrical and Computer</a> Engineering.</p>
                    <h3 class="service-heading">What we do</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted text-justified">We develop hardware, collect data, and use machine learning to improve human-computer interaction. We measure how people move their bodies and their hands, find regularities that render that data easier to work with, and create bidirectional interfaces between the human and the machine.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted text-justified">We study how humans and other animals sense their bodies and the environment to control movement. We use this understanding to improve mobility for people with lower limb amputation â€“ walking, negotiating stairs, running, jumping. We are building smarter controllers and sensory feedback for prosthetic limbs. We are performing basic research in neural control of movement, how the brain creates a sense of ownership of the body, and more!</p>
                    <p class="text-muted text-justified">We study soft robots and wearables - how to build them, make them move, sense the state of their bodies and the things they interact with. We focus on data-driven sensing, combined sensor-actuators, and exploiting multimodal phenomena for state estimation. </p>

                    <p class="text-muted">The AMP Lab is a collaboration at the University of Washington between the College of Engineering and Rehabilitation Medicine that seeks to amplify human and robotic movement and performance.  The AMP Lab seeks to advance our understanding of the dynamics and control of movement to design treatment strategies and assistive technologies that improve function, performance, and quality of life for people in health and disease.</p>
