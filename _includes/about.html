                    <p class="text-muted text-justified">We seek to understand how humans and other animals sense their bodies and the environment to control movement. We use this understanding to improve mobility for people with lower limb amputation â€“ walking, negotiating stairs, running, jumping. We are building smarter controllers and sensory feedback for prosthetic limbs. We are performing basic research in neural control of movement, how the brain creates a sense of ownership of the body, and more!</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">We are a part of the VA CLiMB in Seattle. We are also with the University of Washington, collaborating with the AMP lab and the Depts. of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">CLiMB's mission is to preserve and enhance mobility in veterans and others with lower limb musculoskeletal impairment or limb loss. Our success is the result of unique laboratory resources and a group of internationally renowned clinicians and scientists with overlapping and complementary expertise in normal and impaired mobility. These include clinical experts in foot/ankle orthopedic surgery and amputee rehabilitation including prosthetic and orthotic restoration; engineers with expertise in foot/ankle biomechanics, prosthetic sensing, and development; psychologists with expertise in the psychosocial dimensions of disability and the obstacles to participation; and epidemiologists and health services researchers who have expertise in the interaction between health care innovation and its implementation. The shared resources of laboratories and experimental expertise in our group include: motion capture, biplane fluoroscopy, robotic gait simulation, mechanical testing, prosthetic and orthotic fabrication, advanced 3D printing, and large data set analysis. </p>

                    <p class="text-muted">The AMP Lab is a collaboration at the University of Washington between the College of Engineering and Rehabilitation Medicine that seeks to amplify human and robotic movement and performance.  The AMP Lab seeks to advance our understanding of the dynamics and control of movement to design treatment strategies and assistive technologies that improve function, performance, and quality of life for people in health and disease.</p>
