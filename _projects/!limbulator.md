blurb: The Limb Simulator aims to reduce phantom limb pain for those who have lost a limb. Most phantom limb pain treatments are palliative in nature – they target individual factors of pain without addressing the underlying cause. By simulating the experience of owning and using an intact limb, Limb Simulator hopes to engage and remodel areas of the brain associated with the lost limb to impact both short and long term outcomes of phantom pain.

## The Vision
Phantom limb pain is a growing problem as the number of people living with limb loss in the United States increases. Current treatment options are either inadequate or impractical. Limb Simulator envisions to become a home-based, self-administered gamified therapy system that leverages advances in virtual reality to create better pain outcomes. By incorporating a sense of ownership over the simulated limb using new and exciting techniques, Limb Simulator goes beyond simply visualizing an intact limb – it integrates into the user’s body image on a deeper level. Harnessing neuroplasticity in this way helps the brain remodel itself to a “normal” body image and thus disentangle the user from their painful phantom limb.

## Current Work
Case studies are being conducted at the Veteran’s Affairs Puget Sound Hospital and Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, WA to guide the development of Limb Simulator. The study team is preparing a fully powered clinical trial to test the effectiveness of the system. Efforts are in progress to improve therapy workflow, to implement new features, and to improve the core technology behind the therapy.
