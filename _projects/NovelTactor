blurb: 

The performance of vibrotactile actuators is affected by the
frequency and amplitude of oscillation, loading on the skin,
and the size of the tactor-skin interface. Commercially
available vibrotactors include eccentric rotating mass (ERM)
devices, which have frequency and amplitude coupled, and
linear resonant actuators (LRAs), which use a resonant
frequency. The frequency is chosen to be easy to feel, but
performance away from that frequency is dramatically
diminished. It can also be difficult to assess the
contribution of skin loading, which is one of the most
crucial factors in actuator performance. There have been many designs for haptic feedback devices but there are still opportunities for improvement.

## Introduction
We present a vibrotactile actuator design that
addresses four of these opportunities at once: 1) the
capability to vary the frequency of stimulation while
keeping amplitude constant 2) small contact area on the
skin, for providing pinpoint locality of stimulation, but also
for packing many stimulators into a small area 3) a novel
means of providing constant loading (normal force pressing
the tactor against the skin) 4) capability to customize the
waveform of stimulation.

We demonstrate that stimulation with increasing amplitude,
and independently with increasing frequency, results in
increased subjective intensity on the thigh. The thigh is an
interesting target because it is one of the least sensitive
areas of the skin but is a natural target for stimulation by a
lower-limb sensory feedback prosthesis. The effects as we
vary amplitude and frequency appear consistent with those
previously observed for hand.

## Application

We have developed a dense array of these vibrotactors
for use in rich sensory feedback applications, e.g. facial
tactile stimulation integrated with virtual reality
