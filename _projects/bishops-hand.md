blurb: Why does your hand feel like a part of your body, but your screwdriver does not? We are investigating the mechanisms used by the brain to create a sense of ownership over the body. One of the ways that researchers study this is to measure the reactions to threats to the body. By controlling a person's visual, tactile, and movement cues of their body and the environment, we can STAB STAB STAB STAB

## Introduction
We can induce the feeling that a virtual hand is a part of one’s body. One of the major hurdles for understanding this illusion is that it is a phenomenological, subjective feeling. The widely accepted ways of quantifying whether a person felt the illusion - questionnaire, proprioceptive drift, and galvanic skin response to a threat - each come with shortcomings and limitations. **Problem 1 - We need a better way to measure when someone is feeling the illusion.**

Surprisingly, there has not really been a demonstration that the illusion leads to different motor behavior. Though it may seem obvious that the illusion is compelling and worth inducing, contributing to “presence” (whatever that is supposed to mean,) there has never been an experiment showing a change in movement when the illusion is being felt. **Problem 2 - We haven’t shown whether feeling the illusion actually changes the way one acts.**
