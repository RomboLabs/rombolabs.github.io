title: Attaching wearable devices to the body 
topics: Virtual Reality, Body Ownership, Soft Robotics, Metamaterials, Prosthesis & Orthosis, Haptics
blurb: Take a moment to be mindful of all the objects attached to your body - your clothing, your shoes, your watch and possibly a pair of glasses resting on your nose. While these passive wearable objects are optimally designed to camouflage interaction forces between the human body and the device, the same degree of comfort and function is not available for active wearable devices, such as powered prostheses, exoskeletons, and haptic devices which apply external forces and moments to the human body. This project seeks to develop the fundamental scientific principles behind the design of engineered physical interfaces between humans and machines.

## Introduction
We can design materials to mitigate the effects of external forces and moments on our body due to interaction with daily objects. This is done partly by using geometrical contours like the shapes of handles, and by using smart mechanisms and materials. However, active wearable devices such as powered prostheses, exoskeletons, and haptic interfaces grounded to the human body lack appropriate design of interaction surfaces. The resulting build up of forces and moments over the interaction surface between the human and the machine leads to decreased comfort and functional fit, and is a contributer to disuse of active wearable devices. This challenge is multi-faceted, and we approach it by addressing 4 major themes:
## Themes
 **Theme 1:** Human Measurement  
 We need to quantify the material behavior of the tissues of the body under loads applied at different points and directions.
 **Theme 2:** Design  
 We need to design the ideal match between an engineered material and the human body to promote comfort and function.
 **Theme 3:** Instantiation  
 We need to create tangible and testable instances of the designed materials using commercial materials, and custom 3-D printed or cast structures.
 **Theme 4:** User Testing  
 We need to get user feedback to validate the comfort of the candidate designs, and to quantify the behavior of the interaction between the human and machine system.

## Methods
The following must be accomplished

* Indentation experiments for 20 subjects to quantify the tissue biomechanical characteristics
* A design tool to specify material characteristics for the physical human robot interface material
* Jigs to test the effect of the instantiated physical human robot interface material
