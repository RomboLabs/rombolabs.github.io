blurb: 'Haplets are wireless, finger-worn LRAs. They were created to answer the question: “What is the minimum viable haptics that we can add to the fingers to augment hand tracking in AR?”. Our paper covers the hardware design, validation and a user study with Haplets used in conjunction with a pen. Our results suggest that users are more accurate when drawing with Haplets.'

**[Haplets](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frvir.2021.738613/full)** are wireless, finger-worn LRAs.

Our paper covers the hardware design, validation and a user study with Haplets used in conjunction with a pen. Our results suggest that users are more accurate when drawing with Haplets.

**Cool facts about Haplets**
- They are wireless but have incredibly low latency (1-4 ms).
- Using them with the Quest 2 requires only a dongle plugged into the USB port. No PC required!
- The user study was driven using [Bricklayer](https://github.com/prnthp/experiment-structures).
- Visuals are equally important for haptics, so the virtual hands are fully physics-driven and behave semi-realistically.
