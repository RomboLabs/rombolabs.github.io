blurb: Patients who have undergone Targeted Reinnervation (TR) surgery have restored feelings of phantom limb sensation at the surgery site. Working with TR patients using lower-limb prostheses, we are designing an Arduino-based haptic device that uses vibration to stimulate a feeling of pressure at the bottom of the missing foot. The qualities and location of the vibration depend on the position of the prosthetic foot in contact with the ground, communicated to the Arduino through an insole array of force-sensitive resistors. We aim to use this method of sensory feedback in order to design a prosthesis that would enable individuals to go down the stairs with more confidence in their foot placement, a task that is generally very attention-consuming.
