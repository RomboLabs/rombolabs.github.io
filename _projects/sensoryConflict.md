## Introduction
Perception is created through the rich interplay of multiple sensory modalities which historically have been difficult to quantify. It is also interwined with internal models of the body and expectations of its movement and the outside world. To make sense of sensation, it is tempting to isolate modalities and study them singly, but this is made difficult by the unexpected ways that the neural and mechanical systems interact. There has been a heroic effort to document and explan how multiple sensory modalities work together, sometimes with contradictory conclusions. 
Instead of obeserving different sensing modalities under normal circumstances, we intentionally induce conflict between two senses to isolate the contributions of each.  

## Sensitivity to Conflict between Visual Touch and Tactile Touch
One of the most consistent observations in sensory related research is that visual sensation appears to take perceptual preference over other senses in many contexts. Thus, in our research, we focus on introducing conflict between vision and touch. We hypothesize that in visuotactile perception, if vision is indeed dominant, the smallest noticeable intrapersonal spatial conflict between vision and taction will be different than from a purely tactile one. There have been fewer studies of conflict than general multisensory perception because creating precise errors between senses requires elaborate experimental apparatus. The recent advances in "virtual reality" (VR) provide an opportunity to isolate vision from other senses more easily and accurately than ever before.

## Visuotactile Two-Point Discrimination Test (VT Test)
We developed a protocol analogous to the tactile two-point discrimination test that allows for the study of spatial conflict between visual touch and tactile touch. In the original test, subjects are asked to discern whether one or two simuli are present while the experimenter touches the subject with either one or two stimulation instruments. Thoroughout the experiment, the subject's vision is blocked.
  In our protocol, however, only one stimulation point is tactile while the other is visual as depicted below.

  We seek to use this information to restore sensory feedback in lower limb amputees who received the Targeted Muscle Reinnervation (TMR) procedure. Sensory feedback will be delivered to the user of a sensorized prosthetic limb, providing a "pass-through" for touch. By understanding the spatial resolution of the skin through the VT Test, we can better inform the required density of the tactor array. Understanding visuotactile conflict is also important in the design of haptic hardware for other applications such as VR haptic interfaces.
