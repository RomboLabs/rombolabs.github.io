blurb: Imagine yourself wearing a pair of ski boots. Imagine yourself having to wear a medical boot because you tripped and sprained your ankle. Imagine yourself wearing a prosthetic leg having to walk down the staircase. Smart step is a smart wearable device that can tell you how to descend the stairs intuitively.
