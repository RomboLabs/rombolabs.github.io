title: Targeted Muscle Reinnervation Mapping
topics: Body Ownership
blurb: Targeted Reinnervation (TR) surgery is a groundbreaking intervention for amputees, enabling them to feel authentic sensations on their missing limb. Despite incredible innovation in creating prosthetic systems that take advantage of TR's sensory phenomena, there has been limited study in characterizing the nature of the sensations, and how they develop over time. We aim to explicitly outline the exact qualities of the stimulus at the surgery site that elicits particular sensations in the phantom limb, like pressure, itching, or scratching. This characterization will inform the design of future prostheses to more richly simulate the myriad feelings of the world with which we interact.

## Introduction
The effects of TR surgery have been studied in the upper limb, but have remained largely unexplored in the lower limb. The characteristics of the stimulus we aim to explore include the threshold at which a sensation in the phantom limb is felt, the quality of the sensation elicited, the density of the distribution of sensation, and the location to which the stimulus maps to. The latter is of particular interest, as identifying which locations of the surgical site correspond to which locations on the phantom limb paves the way for developing prostheses that simulate sensations accurately. Additionally, this mapping can be used to study the patterns of neural regrowth post-surgery.
